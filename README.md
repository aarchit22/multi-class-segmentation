The method of using this is to first run the dependencies.ipynb file to download all the requirements, then use this command:
python segmentation.py -i 'input_directory_to_rgb_image' --target_class 'person' --show --conf_thresholdÂ 0.95

Here,
segmentation.py is our file which contains the models used in trimap, alpha matte and foreground estimation.
